This is a 3-hour collective intelligence workshop aimed at deconstructing the mechanisms of sexism and envisioning a more equal society. Inspired by the format of the Climate Fresk, this workshop was created by the Fresque du Sexisme association and is currently being implemented throughout France. It not only provides key information and statistics on sexism but also offers a small group discussion space where women and men can share their experiences and thoughts on gender-related expectations."

    "text": "I have been a PhD student in statistics since October 2023 at IRMAR, under the supervision of Loïc Le Marrec, Véronique Thelen and Ioana Gavra. My research focuses on the partitioning of graphs with heterogeneous attributes using methods from optimal transport, with a particular emphasis on the Gromov–Wasserstein distance. My work is motivated by the analysis of mobility patterns within a road network, using the city of Châteaubourg as my playground.\nGraduated from ENSAI, I worked for six years as a Data Scientist. This professional experience allowed me to develop strong expertise in handling real-world data, as well as solid skills in scientific communication and knowledge dissemination. After an initial teaching experience in an engineering school, I decided to pursue a PhD as a new step in my career, driven by my interest in ethical issues. My research explores both concrete applications in the field of mobility and methodological contributions to statistics in a broader context.\nI am currently in the final year of my PhD and am seeking a postdoctoral position in applied statistics. During my doctoral research, I have worked on topics including clustering, functional data analysis, graph data, and optimal transport. I am also highly interested in other statistical problems, such as anomaly detection and domain adaptation, as well as in other application areas, particularly in the social sciences and economics."
