    "text": "I have been a PhD student in statistics since October 2023 at IRMAR, under the supervision of Lo√Øc Le Marrec, V√©ronique Thelen and Ioana Gavra. I am interested in the partitioning of attributed graphs using methods derived from optimal transport. My application focuses on movements within a road network, using the city of Ch√¢teaubourg as my playground.\nGraduated from ENSAI, I worked for six years as a Data Scientist. My professional experience has allowed me to acquire expertise in handling real data and the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. After teaching at an engineering school, my PhD marks a new step, driven by my interest in ethical issues and exploring practical applications in the field of mobility."

This is a 3-hour collective intelligence workshop aimed at deconstructing the mechanisms of sexism and envisioning a more equal society. Inspired by the format of the Climate Fresk, this workshop was created by the Fresque du Sexisme association and is currently being implemented throughout France. It not only provides key information and statistics on sexism but also offers a small group discussion space where women and men can share their experiences and thoughts on gender-related expectations."
